This project implements steganography to hide secret messages inside images by modifying pixel values in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye. The program reads an image using OpenCV (cv2) and embeds the message into the RGB pixel values. A mapping dictionary is used to convert characters into corresponding pixel intensity values. The encrypted image is saved as a new file, ensuring the original remains unchanged. To retrieve the hidden message, the program reads pixel data and reconstructs the text. A password-based authentication system ensures only authorized users can decrypt the data. This method allows secure, discreet communication without noticeable changes to the image.
