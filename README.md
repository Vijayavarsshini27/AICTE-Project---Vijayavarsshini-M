This project utilizes steganography to conceal secret messages within images by subtly modifying pixel values, ensuring the changes remain imperceptible to the human eye. The program employs OpenCV (cv2) to process an image and embed the message within its RGB pixel values. A mapping dictionary translates characters into corresponding pixel intensity values for encoding. The encrypted image is saved as a separate file, preserving the original image. To extract the hidden message, the program analyzes pixel data and reconstructs the text. A password-based authentication system restricts access, allowing only authorized users to decrypt the information. This approach enables secure and discreet communication without visibly altering the image.
